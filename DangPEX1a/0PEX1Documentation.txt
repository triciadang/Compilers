I helped Nick Baietto figure out how to compile the project using SableCC and Visual Studios and what we were supposed to editfrom the EI I got, and Nick Baietto told me how to tell if a test case worked and didn't work by seeing the unknown token from the EI he got. C1C Matt Kuhn explained to me that I didn't need to implement everything in the language specifications document and how for the program control, I just needed to make tokens for the key terms and that was it.
